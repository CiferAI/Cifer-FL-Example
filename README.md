#Cifer-FL-Example
#Cifer-FL-Example is a comprehensive example repository designed to demonstrate the implementation of Federated Learning (FL) using the Cifer framework. This project provides a basic template to help users quickly set up and experiment with federated learning models across decentralized clients.

Key Features:
Federated Learning Setup: Example code for training a model on multiple clients without sharing raw data.
Server and Client Interaction: Demonstrates communication between the server and clients using gRPC-based protocols.
Model Aggregation: Includes model aggregation techniques to combine results from different clients.
Pre-built Components: A collection of pre-defined models and datasets to kickstart your federated learning projects.
Getting Started:
Clone the repository and follow the steps in the documentation to run the example locally or on distributed nodes. This example is ideal for users wanting to explore the potential of federated learning without delving deep into complex configurations.
